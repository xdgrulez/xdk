@section Dimensions

@subsection Defining dimensions
Each grammar file defines a set of @emph{dimensions}.
@cindex dimension
A dimension definition consists of:
@enumerate
@item type definitions (see @ref{Types})
@item a specification of used principles on that dimension (see @ref{Principles})
@item a specification of used outputs on that dimension (see @ref{Outputs1})
@end enumerate

In the UL, a dimension definition is written:
@example
defdim <constant> @{<dimension definition>@}
@end example
where @code{<constant>} is the dimension identifier for the defined
dimension.

Notice that the XDK supports a special dimension: @code{lex}.
@cindex lex dimension
The @code{lex} dimension serves to assign a word to each lexical
entry, and must be defined in each grammar file. It cannot be turned
off - the lexicon is always used.

@subsection Using dimensions
From the set of defined dimensions, each grammar file uses a subset.
To use a dimension, you write:
@example
usedim <constant>
@end example
where @code{<constant>} is the dimension identifier of the used
dimension.
