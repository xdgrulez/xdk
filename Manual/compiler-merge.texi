@section Merge
The XDK grammar file compiler allows to @emph{merge}
@cindex merge
an arbitrary number of grammars into one. Two grammars @math{g_1} and
@math{g_2} can be merged into @math{g_3} if they have the same type
definitions.

The merge operation is defined as follows:
@itemize @bullet
@item the lexicon of @math{g_3} includes all the lexical entries of
@math{g_1} and @math{g_2} (i.e. @math{g_3} maps each word to the union
of the set of lexical entries for this word in @math{g_1} and
@math{g_2})
@item the dimension definitions of @math{g_3} are taken from
@math{g_2}
@end itemize

If more than two grammars @math{g_i} (@math{1<=i<=n}, and @math{n>2})
are merged, the last grammar in the sequence determines the dimension
definitions of the merged grammar.
