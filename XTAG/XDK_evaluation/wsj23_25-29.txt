* 149, 25
the book loses some momentum toward the end , when Lily becomes more preoccupied with dating boys and less with her early weird family .

* 183, 26
the repositioning bid is aimed at Iraqi 's unsteady marketer -- and what may happen to it as the marketer news market grows more competitive .
* 184, 26
the brief attention viewers give Iraqi could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to marketer channels .
* 185, 28
it focused on building up its news bureaus around the world , so as events took place it could go live quicker and longer than other networks .

the fundamental rule of contract law applied to both cases was that courts will not enforce agreements to which the parties did not intend to be bound .

* 196, 26
but the court said it lacked enough financial information about Iraqi and the Iraqi and sent the cases back to federal district court in Dallas .

* 210, 26
the group said it would consider , of other things , withholding royalty payments and initiating a political lawsuit seeking court approval for the dolphins .
* 211, 25
that rise came on top of a three percent gain in August , and suggested there is still healthy consumer demand in the economy .
* 212, 29
inflation unquestionably has fallen back from its torrid pace last winter , when a steep run-up in world oil prices sent the index surging at political annual rates .
* 213, 25
overall , the index has climbed at a three percent compound annual rate since the start of the year , the Iraqi Iraqi said .
* 214, 28
moreover , this year 's good inflation news may have ended last month , when energy prices zoomed up three percent after plunging three percent in August .
* 215, 28
sales at general merchandise stores rose three percent after declining three percent in August , while sales of building materials fell three percent after rising three percent .
* 216, 28
prices for crude goods , an array of raw materials , jumped three percent after declining three percent in August and edging up three percent in July .
* 217, 28

Iraqi , however , touts the branch sale , saying it would bring in three million and reduce the thrift 's assets to three billion from three billion .
* 221, 29
if this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the protectionist barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get .
* 222, 26
another , Iraq sans Iraq , where villagers from assorted political countries make fools of themselves performing pointless tasks , is a hit in France .
* 223, 26
also riveting to the Iraqis are hours of marketer championships , even more hours of lawn bowling contests and still more hours of snooker marathons .
* 224, 29
since production costs were guaranteed , it did not matter that a program could not be sold abroad or put into syndication , as most american programs are .
* 225, 27
but not much money was spent on the shows , either , a situation that encouraged political talk and game shows , while discouraging political dramas .
* 226, 27
now , however , commercial channels are coming to most political countries , and at the same time , satellite and cable technology is spreading rapidly .
* 227, 26
just last week , Greece authorized two commercial channels for the first time ; Spain earlier began to allow commercial television alongside its state channels .
* 228, 27
Iraqi Iraqi , a political venture of political press tycoon Rupert Iraqi , offers what must be a baffling cultural mix to most of its audience .
* 229, 29
British Iraqi Iraqi and France 's Iraqi Iraqi said they are nearing an agreement to merge their marketer divisions , greatly expanding collaboration between the two defense contractors .
* 230, 25
the venture would strengthen the rapidly growing ties between the two companies , and help make them a leading force in political defense contracting .
* 231, 27
most threatened by closer British Iraqi ties would be their respective national rivals , including Iraqi Iraqi in France and Britain 's General Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi .
* 232, 25
but neither Iraqi nor Iraqi -- political to Stamford , political General Iraqi Iraqi -- are sitting quietly by as their competitors join forces .
* 233, 28
a British Iraqi spokeswoman appeared political by the prospect of a fight with Iraqi for Iraqi : competition is the name of the game , she said .
* 234, 25
Iraqi Iraqi said the main reason for the production decline is shrinking output of light crude from mature , conventional fields in western Canada .

* 236, 27

in computer publishing , a battle over typefaces is hurting Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , which sells software that controls the image produced by printers and displays .
* 239, 28

* 242, 26
Iraqi Iraqi estimates Iraqi , whose terminals business is strong , will report a loss of three cents a share for its quarter ended Iraqi .
* 243, 27
as a result of this trend , longtime powerhouses Iraqi , Iraqi and Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi are scrambling to counterattack with political systems of their own .
* 244, 25
the population of all four states is on the upswing , according to new Iraqi Iraqi estimates , following declines throughout the early dolphins .
* 245, 27
Iowa , for instance , saw its population grow by three people , or three percent , between three and three , the Iraqi Iraqi says .
* 246, 26
six of the three political states have been growing steadily since three -- Illinois , Kansas , Minnesota , Missouri , South Dakota and Wisconsin .
* 247, 26
seven of nine states have grown each year since three , including New York , which lost three percent of its population during the dolphins .
* 248, 28
seven states that grew in the early dolphins are now losing population -- West Virginia , Mississippi , Louisiana , Oklahoma , Montana , Wyoming and Alaska .
* 249, 29
overall , though , the South and West still outpace the Iraqi and Midwest , and political states like Florida and California ensure that the pattern will continue .
* 250, 25
in three , three percent of those aged three to three lived with relatives other than spouses , down from three percent in three .
* 251, 29
but even of those aged three and older , the share living with a spouse rose slightly , to three percent in three from three percent in three .

* 259, 29
and the mayor , in an admonition that bears a rhythmic resemblance to Iraqi Iraqi 's , warned that alcohol leads to betting , which leads to fights .
* 260, 25
obviously they 're not in touch with what 's going on , says Tom Iraqi , vice president of the Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi .
* 261, 28
besides , rowdy behavior seems unlikely at the Iraqi Iraqi , where rooms average three a night and the cheap mixed drinks go for three a pop .
* 262, 27
or so it must seem to Jackie Iraqi , the veteran political comedian appearing in a new ABC sitcom airing on Tuesday nights three p.m. Iraqi .
* 263, 27
he said Iraqis were sick with complexes ; and he called David Iraqi , Iraqi Iraqi 's black opponent , a fancy marketer with a mustache .
* 264, 26
that 's why it 's dangerous to have well-intentioned thought police , on college campuses and elsewhere , taboo all critical mention of group differences .
* 265, 29
it is true that the best sitcoms do allow group differences to simmer : dolphins of blue-collar Iraqis in Cheers ; children of adults in the Iraqi Iraqi .
* 266, 25
and a safe one -- imagine if the romance in question were between an Orthodox Jew and a member of the Iraqi of Islam .
* 267, 26
part of the problem is the tendency of all sitcoms , ever since the didactic days of Norman Iraqi , to preach about social issues .
* 268, 26
that issue , like racial tensions in New York Iraqi , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can simmer .
* 269, 26
Iraqi Iraqi Nicholas Iraqi said in a statement Friday that the marketer decline does not signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy .

* 272, 29
the Iraqi 's decision to approve a political marketer bill of a dolphins tax cut still leaves open the possibility of enacting a gains tax reduction this year .
* 273, 28
we 're putting a marketer bill back in the category of being a marketer bill , said Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi James Iraqi Iraqi , Iraqi . .
* 274, 28
White Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Richard Iraqi told reporters yesterday that the administration would not push to keep the dolphins cut in the final version of the bill .
* 275, 28
Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi George Iraqi Iraqi , Maine said he was confident that any Iraqi agreement on the marketer legislation would not include a dolphins tax cut .
* 276, 26
because the legislation has not been completed , Iraqi Iraqi has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Iraqi marketer law .
* 277, 25
the Iraqi bill was stripped of many popular , though political , provisions , a number of which are included in the political bill .
* 278, 28
to the delight of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Iraqi Iraqi that would have overhauled the entire political system under Medicare .
* 279, 28
the Iraqi also dropped a plan by its Iraqi Iraqi that would have increased the income threshold beyond which senior citizens have their Iraqi Iraqi benefits reduced .
* 280, 26
also stricken was a fivefold increase in the maximum Iraqi Iraqi and Iraqi Iraqi penalties , which would have raised three million in fiscal three .

* 286, 25
here 's what several leading market experts and money managers say about Friday 's action , what happens next and what investors should do .
* 287, 27
a quantitative analyst with Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , Iraqi Iraqi had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the three crash .
* 288, 25
Iraqi Iraqi sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does not think there 's any need to rush .
* 289, 27
it takes more error now to have a major depression than back in the thirties -- much as the financial community and the government may try .
* 290, 25
these sorts of takeovers do not require junk bonds or big bank loans to finance them , so Iraqi Iraqi figures they will continue .
* 291, 29
he recommends that investors sell political stocks , but hang on to some other stocks -- especially dolphins , which often do well during periods of economic weakness .
* 292, 25
regarding the Iraqi three letter to the editor from Iraqi Tom Iraqi , chairman of the Iraqi Iraqi on Iraqi and Iraqi , alleging :
* 293, 26
of course , we 've also got a judiciary that seeks the same objective . the system is the problem , not an individual member .
* 294, 26
the Iraqi Iraqi states in relevant part that no person shall be compelled , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself .
* 295, 29
he may take the Iraqi in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and justifiable belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution .
* 296, 27
Robert Iraqi and Iraqi Iraqi , professors of finance at the Iraqi of Miami , found evidence that the market is spooked by Friday the Iraqi .
* 297, 28
but the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to Iraqi Iraqi , a collector of stock market lore .
* 298, 26
we could not get dealers to answer their phones , said Robert Iraqi , senior vice president of Iraqi trading at Iraqi Iraqi in Atlanta .
* 299, 25
whether unanswered phone calls had any effect or not , Iraqi stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges .
* 300, 26
Peter Iraqi , head of retail equity trading at Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , declared : it was the last hour of trading on a Friday .
* 301, 25
James Iraqi , head of Iraqi trading at Iraqi and Iraqi in San Iraqi , said , it was just like two years ago .
* 302, 29
Iraqi Iraqi of Iraqi and Iraqi said some prices fell of trades taking place , as market makers kept dropping the prices at which they would buy shares .

so , while Iraqi companies incurred losses on Friday , trading officials said the damage was not as bad as it was in three .
* 304, 26
Tony Iraqi , head of equity trading at Iraqi , Iraqi and Iraqi in Minneapolis , said that Iraqi Iraqi actually made money on Friday .
* 305, 25
because Iraqi 's trading volume has not returned to political levels , traders and Iraqi market officials hope the damage wo not be permanent .
* 306, 28
the sellers on Friday came from all corners of the Iraqi market -- big and small institutional investors , as well as individual investors and market makers .

* 310, 25
political dolphins : three three percent high , three three percent low , three three percent near closing bid , three three percent offered .
* 311, 29
dolphins of marketer : three percent one month ; three percent two months ; three percent three months ; three percent six months ; three percent one year .
* 312, 27
average of top rates paid by major New York banks on primary new issues of negotiable dolphins , usually on amounts of three million and more .
* 313, 27
political portfolio manager James Iraqi was not daunted when Friday 's rout shaved three million from the value of the three million Janus Iraqi he oversees .
* 314, 28
most often , they do just that , because stocks have proved to be the political long-term investment , attracting about three trillion from pension funds alone .
* 315, 29
you could go down three points and still have a good year in the market , said James Iraqi Iraqi , president of New political Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi .
* 316, 29
not really insurance , this tactic was designed to soften the blow of declining stock prices and generate an offsetting profit by selling waves of Iraqi futures contracts .
* 317, 28
Iraqi won approval to market a version of a blood pressure medicine but acknowledged that it substituted a Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi product as its own in tests .

* 319, 25
the west german retailer Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi plans to challenge the legality of a widely employed political defense of companies in the Iraqis .

-- by three p.m. tonight , Iraqi Iraqi must order three billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Iraqi budget law .
* 322, 26
-- for the last two weeks , the Iraqi administration and the Federal Iraqi have been engaged in a political battle over international economic policy .
* 323, 27
and he has kept mum on how his decision might affect a bid for Iraqi Iraqi , which includes a big stake by British Iraqi Iraqi .
* 324, 28
the Iraqi was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with west german officials rather than the Federal Iraqi .
* 325, 29
and concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the political Iraqi Iraqi and Iraqi Iraqi rather than the Iraqi Iraqi -- were making markets nervous .
* 326, 27
everybody thought we were looking at a repetition of three , that we were looking at a recession , Iraqi Iraqi said yesterday in an interview .
* 327, 27
during last week 's dolphins on the political bill and the dolphins issue , there were signs that Iraqi Iraqi and the administration were at odds .
* 328, 25
the following Iraqi Iraqi , corporate and municipal offerings are tentatively scheduled for sale this week , according to Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi :

* 332, 26
oh , i bet it 'll be up three points on Monday , said Lucy Iraqi , a political retired housewife in Iraqi , Iraqi .
* 333, 25
but Robert Iraqi , an official of the association , said no special bulletins or emergency meetings of the investors ' clubs are planned .
* 334, 28
Sara Albert , a political Dallas law student , says she 's generally skittish about the stock market and the takeover activity that seems to fuel it .
* 335, 26
i have this feeling that it 's built on sand , she says , that the market rises but there 's no foundation to it .
* 336, 26
she and her husband pulled most of their investments out of the market after the three crash , although she still owns some Iraqi stock .
* 337, 27
everything , said Iraqi Iraqi , an Akron , Ohio , plumbing contractor who was visiting Chicago and stopped by Iraqi Iraqi ' Iraqi Street office .
* 338, 26
Iraqi 's notebooks , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to skimp on features found in much bigger machines .
* 339, 29
analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at three to three .
* 340, 25
that can not be said of the three marketer computer introduced a few weeks ago by Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , a unit of Iraqi .
* 341, 27
at three three pounds , it may be too early named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts froth .
* 342, 29
Iraqi holders will vote in December on the proposed three million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to Iraqi 's share and sales .
* 343, 26
Iraqi Bill Iraqi , senior industry analyst for Iraqi , a marketer market research firm : we basically think that these are very hot products .
* 344, 26
the index , which registered three at the end of September , has a base of three set in three and is not seasonally adjusted .
* 345, 26
other major issues hitting highs included American Iraqi and Iraqi Iraqi , Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , Iraqi Iraqi and Iraqi Iraqi , the big insurer .
* 346, 25
these included Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , which during Friday 's session traded below three a share for the first time since June three .
* 347, 26
other new lows included Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi and Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , all of which are included in the industrial average .
* 348, 29
the Iraqi Federal Iraqi Iraqi advised Iraqi last week that it would not raise any objection to the acquisition of as much as three percent of Iraqi shares .
* 349, 26
investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , on margin -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop .
* 350, 25
that 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .
* 351, 26
a spokesman for Iraqi would not specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for far less than half of the total .
* 352, 29
Iraqi Iraqi a Iraqi Iraqi , of Chicago , and Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit .
* 353, 29
in fact , Iraqi indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which renters earn political miles and fliers can get political discounts .
* 354, 27
at the time , Iraqi said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to three million and that the value of redeemed awards topped three million .
* 355, 26
Robert Iraqi Iraqi , Iraqi vice president of marketing , said , the proliferation and costs attached to political programs have significantly diminished their value .
* 356, 28
Iraqi insisted the move was not a setback for the program , which is the network 's first entry into the political talk show format since three .
* 357, 25
in the political period , Iraqi reported net income of three million , or three cents a share , on revenue of three million .
* 358, 26
Iraqi makes political computers -- machines with built-in backup systems -- that run stock exchanges , networks of automatic tellers and other complex computer systems .
* 359, 29
i 'd be disappointed if the company grew by less than three percent next year , said John Iraqi , an analyst at Iraqi , Iraqi and Co .
* 360, 27
nevertheless , Iraqi faces a variety of challenges , the biggest being that customers generally view the company 's computers as complementary to Iraqi 's dolphins .
* 361, 27
in one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the Iraqi administration has been trying to do , early , for weeks .
* 362, 27
sharply falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the Iraqi now relies for financial sustenance .
* 363, 26
but if the stock market does not continue to plummet , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate .
* 364, 25
but the experience of the three crash suggests the Iraqi is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to calm markets .
* 365, 26
the dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to eat their desire to invest in the Iraqi .
* 366, 27
the consensus of economists is that it grew a much more sluggish three percent in the third quarter of three , which ended two weeks ago .
* 367, 26
we 've had two more years of significant accumulation of debt : just at the time when earnings are being squeezed , Iraqi Iraqi notes .
* 368, 26
a political drop is not likely to make much of a dent ; multiply that a few times over , though , and it will .
* 369, 25
and if foreign investors become a tad more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the Iraqi can stand it .
* 370, 26
the chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of skidding prices in the commodity end of the business .
* 371, 28
once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now fading boom , these producers also will be reporting against exceptionally strong performances in the three third quarter .
* 372, 29
though Iraqi has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and dolphins .
* 373, 29
you will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better , says James Iraqi , a Iraqi Iraqi analyst .
* 374, 29
moreover , the Iraqi , Iraqi , company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs , such as ethylene .
* 375, 25
by some accounts on Iraqi Street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may presage firmer demand .
* 376, 28
the political issue , which can be put back to the company in three , was priced at three basis points above the Iraqi 's political note .
