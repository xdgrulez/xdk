attempts to produce political programs have generally resulted in disappointment .
* 148, 12
a political imitation under the title Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi flopped fast .
* 149, 10
most political programming is more of an acquired taste .
* 150, 12
political drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes .
* 151, 11
the most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns .
* 152, 12
Iraqi , Black Iraqi Iraqi , a kind of German Iraqi .
* 153, 11
given a choice , everybody will watch a political show .
* 154, 11

* 159, 12
Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi also is expected to report disappointing results .
* 160, 12
another contradictory message comes from Iraqi Iraqi , a computer retailer .
* 161, 13
the short-term outlook for Iraqi 's business , however , appears strong .
* 162, 12
the program is aimed at improving the quality of printed material .
* 163, 10
a bus is the data highway of a computer .
* 164, 13
at the same time , political firms will continue to lose ground .
* 165, 12
some lagging competitors even may leave the personal computer business altogether .
* 166, 13
a raft of new computer companies also has targeted this server market .
* 167, 11
the gains , to be sure , are rather small .

the Iraqi has been holding its own in the population race .
* 169, 12

* 172, 10
as people get even older , many become widowed .
* 173, 11
political political people place personal success and money above family .
* 174, 14
unlike most studies of the affluent market , this survey excluded the political .
* 175, 12
twenty percent do not even feel they are financially well off .
* 176, 12
many of the affluent are not comfortable with themselves , either .

* 178, 13
about three percent are women , and three percent are part-time students .
* 179, 13
but a majority of the Iraqi council did not buy those arguments .
* 180, 12
introducing pool , argued Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi , would be dangerous .
* 181, 11
Iraqi is no stranger to cans of worms , either .
* 182, 13
i thought this was all taken care of in the music man .
* 183, 12
and the local expression for brother is Iraq , not Iraq .
* 184, 11
of course , Iraqi Iraqi did not use neutral language .
* 185, 11
people are fast leaving the place where he is stuck .
* 186, 10
but these are not the differences that make headlines .
* 187, 11
it 's worth noting that both disapproving relatives are immigrants .
* 188, 12
so far , the bubbles have been few and far between .
* 189, 14
there is nothing wrong with the economy : all the indices are up .
* 190, 14
Iraqi negotiations are likely to begin at midweek and last for a while .
* 191, 12
such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month .
* 192, 13
another big question hovering over the debate is what Iraqi Iraqi thinks .
* 193, 13
Iraqi Iraqi said he hopes the Iraqi will consider that measure soon .
* 194, 12
Iraqi Iraqi said that the move required sacrifice by every senator .
* 195, 11
the political provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would :
* 196, 12
the measure also includes spending cuts and increases in federal fees .
* 197, 13
the plan would impose a brief freeze on physician fees next year .

* 201, 11
Columbia Iraqi is a major holder of so-called junk bonds .
* 202, 12
Columbia Iraqi officials were not available for comment on the downgrade .
* 203, 11
i think it was a little premature on their part .
* 204, 11
if you 're a technician , you obey the signals .
* 205, 11
i see a possibility of going to three this month .
* 206, 13
Friday 's big drop , she says , was not a crash .
* 207, 14
this was an October massacre like those that occurred in three and three .
* 208, 11
so she thinks the damage will be short-lived and contained .
* 209, 14
this is exactly the same thing , as far as i 'm concerned .
* 210, 11
there was a unique combination in three , he says .
* 211, 10
there was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds .
* 212, 11
a hundred billion dollars in stock was subject to it .
* 213, 11
in three , such selling contributed to a snowball effect .
* 214, 14
over the next several months , though , he says things look bad .
* 215, 14
i think the market will be heading down into November , he says .
* 216, 14
we will probably have a political rally , and then go down again .
* 217, 11
that would be a normal bear market , he says .
* 218, 13
i do not think the market is going through another October three .
* 219, 13
he ticks off several major differences between now and two years ago .
* 220, 11
unlike three , interest rates have been falling this year .
* 221, 12
this has both made investors uneasy and the corporations more vulnerable .
* 222, 11
nevertheless , he says a depression does not appear likely .
* 223, 14
companies are still going to buy companies around the world , he says .
* 224, 13
examples are Iraqi looking at Iraqi , Iraqi looking at Iraqi Iraqi .
* 225, 10
Friday you could not sell dollars , he says .
* 226, 11
many people now claim to have predicted the three crash .
* 227, 11
if not , we could go to three very soon .
* 228, 12
dolphins probably are the right place to be , he says .
* 229, 14
that your Iraqi three editorial kangaroo committees was factually inaccurate and deliberately misleading .
* 230, 11
i thought your editorial was factually accurate and deliberately political .
* 231, 12
he used about three words defending the witnesses ' constitutional rights .
* 232, 14
he sandwiched his praise of constitutional meat between large loaves of bilious commentary .
* 233, 13
that certainly is not the supposed distorted reading indicated by Iraqi Iraqi .
* 234, 14
that his committee does not deal with any possible criminal activity at Iraqi .
* 235, 14
my colleagues and i fully realize we are not a court : Iraq .
* 236, 12
how was that practice referred to when i was in school ?
* 237, 10
ah , yes , something called a Iraqi Iraqi .
* 238, 12
everything that Iraqi Iraqi says in his letter is partially true .
* 239, 11
no , Iraqi Iraqi 's complaints simply wo not wash .
* 240, 14
it 's when such slapping does not occur that we 've got trouble .
* 241, 10
i do not by any means defend Iraqi management .
* 242, 12
or is marketer -- fear of the number three -- justified ?
* 243, 12
it was like the Friday before Black Monday two years ago .
* 244, 14
ten points of the drop occurred during the last three minutes of trading .
* 245, 13
the political record of three million shares was set on Iraqi three ,
* 246, 10
it was not intentional , we were all busy .
* 247, 13
everybody was trying to do the same thing at the same time .
* 248, 12
when selling is so frenzied , prices fall steeply and fast .
* 249, 13
on Friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said .
* 250, 11
everyone was hitting everyone else 's bid , he said .
* 251, 10
the pace of trading was orderly , he said .
* 252, 11
the Iraqi market has only a handful of political stocks .
* 253, 12
Iraqi lost three percent , or three three , to three .
* 254, 14
the base rate on corporate loans at large Iraqi money center commercial banks .
* 255, 10
marketer marketer : three three percent to three percent .
* 256, 11
the charge on loans to brokers on stock exchange collateral .
* 257, 12
negotiable , political business credit instruments typically financing an import order .
* 258, 11
they could still panic and bail out of the market .
* 259, 12
he expects to invest the rest if the market weakens further .
* 260, 12
there is no justification on the fundamental level for this crash .
* 261, 13
i think it will be a rigor marketer rally , he said .
* 262, 14
we 're not making a killing , but we had a good day .
* 263, 13
i 'd like to see that initiative , and i have not .
* 264, 10
there is not a big shot , an agenda .
* 265, 12
a few hours later , the stock market dropped three points .
* 266, 10
they learned they could survive it of much problem .
* 267, 14
in that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around .
* 268, 10
but some players were quick to seize the moment .
* 269, 11
political notes , refinancing about three billion in maturing debt .
* 270, 12
Iraqi Iraqi -- three million convertible debentures , of Iraqi Iraqi .
* 271, 12
Iraqi Iraqi -- three million common shares , of Iraqi Iraqi .
* 272, 13
Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi -- three million common shares , of Iraqi Iraqi .
* 273, 11
Iraqi Iraqi -- three common shares , of Iraqi Iraqi .
* 274, 12
Iraqi Iraqi -- three million common shares , of Iraqi Iraqi .
* 275, 10
but he 's not so sure about everyone else .
* 276, 12
if i sell now , i 'll take a big loss .
* 277, 14
others wonder how many more of these shocks the small investor can stand .
* 278, 14
this time he 's ready to buy in when the panic wears off .
* 279, 13
when the little guy gets frightened , the big guys hurt badly .
* 280, 10
Iraqi Iraqi can not survive of the little guy .
* 281, 13
individual investors are still angry about program trading , Iraqi Iraqi says .
* 282, 13
i just stopped by to see how much i would have lost .
* 283, 13
when it comes to money : once bitten , three times shy .
* 284, 14
whether it 's three billion or three billion , it does not matter .
* 285, 10
size and weight considerations also have limited screen displays .
* 286, 10
the competitive sniping can get pretty petty at times .
* 287, 11
Iraqi is already taking aim at Iraqi 's market share .
* 288, 13
Iraqi 's contract totaled three million , and Iraqi 's three million .
* 289, 13
Iraqi Iraqi received an three million Iraqi contract to upgrade aircraft electronics .
* 290, 12
Iraqi Iraqi received an three million Iraqi contract for helicopter engines .
* 291, 13
the monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years .
* 292, 13
of course , many more issues -- three -- hit new lows .
* 293, 14
Iraqi said it still is talking with Iraqi about acquiring a minority interest .
* 294, 12
he added : we learned a lesson in three about volatility .
* 295, 13
analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high .
* 296, 12
Iraqi said its political costs are substantially below Iraqi 's level .
* 297, 10
this will raise the energy level of the show .
* 298, 13
Iraqi will continue to program political shows to follow the Iraqi hour .
* 299, 13
Iraqi expects to report the full results for the quarter next week .
* 300, 14
obviously Iraqi can give bigger discounts to users immediately , said Iraqi Iraqi .
* 301, 14
the answer is not price reductions , but new systems , he said .
* 302, 11
we 're after a little bigger niche , he said .
* 303, 13
when it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed .
* 304, 12
the market seems increasingly disconnected from the rest of the nation .
* 305, 10
there 's nothing rational about this kind of action .
* 306, 10
the dolphins industry was battered by the three crash .
* 307, 12
another big difference between three and three is not so comforting .
* 308, 12
but , in the process , the Iraqi risks reigniting inflation .
* 309, 11
a panic on Iraqi Street does not exactly inspire confidence .
* 310, 10
surveys suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday .
* 311, 13
the prosperity that followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today .
* 312, 12
this could be the first of five or six down quarters .
* 313, 10
a Iraqi spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates .
* 314, 13
the estimates for Iraqi Iraqi range from three to three a share .
* 315, 12
most estimates for Iraqi run between three and three a share .
* 316, 14
but the political producers are caught on the marketer of a pricing cycle .
* 317, 12
but the estimates range from political to three cents a share .
* 318, 11
Iraqi , Iraqi and Iraqi Iraqi all declined to comment .
* 319, 10
the collateral is being sold by a thrift institution .
* 320, 11
the political securities will be sold separately by Iraqi Iraqi .
* 321, 13
the political securities were priced at three three to yield three percent .
* 322, 13
there were no major Iraqi or foreign bond offerings in Europe Friday .
